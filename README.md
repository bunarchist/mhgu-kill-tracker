# Monster Hunter: Generations Ultimate Kill Tracker

This is just a simple checklist that has all the monsters from Monster Hunter Generations Ultimate and also a rating for each monster panel to rate how much you liked fighting each monster. 

You can check it out through the GitHub pages link on the right hand side of this repository or on my personal website [here](https://gallade.xyz/mhgu-tracker/).
